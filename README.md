# Udacity Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree Projects

This repo is a collection of projects for the Udacity MLND program.

### Machine Learning Foundations

Explored the basics of machine learning by predicting housing prices on the Boston Housing Dataset.
This project introduced the concepts of training and testing sets, basic decision trees, and regression algorithms.

### Supervised Learning

Determined the best segment of people to solicit for donations based on several features from a dataset.
Learned about naive predictors, metrics for determining model performance, and several supervised learning algorithms.
Decision trees, KNN, SVC, logistic regression, and Gaussian naive Bayes were all compared using cross validation techniques.

### Unsupervised Learning

Using a dataset of sales figures, customers were categorized into segments based on their purchases. The number of segments was determined by cross-validation. Outliers were found and removed from the dataset. Gaussian Mixture and PCA were used to find the best separation between clusters.

### Reinforcement Learning
Reinforcement learning was used to train a cab to make the correct decisions while navigating busy intersections.

### Deep Learning

Convolutional Neural Networks and Transfer learning were used to detect faces in images and then predict breeds from new pictures. The same algorithm was then adapted to predict which dog breeds humans looked like.
